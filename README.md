# Data Engineering Lifecycle and Key Stakeholders

## Overview
This project explores the **Data Engineering Lifecycle**, outlining each stage from data collection to deployment. It also identifies the key **stakeholders** involved and their roles in ensuring successful data-driven solutions.

## Lifecycle Stages
1. **Data Ingestion** – Collecting data from various sources.  
2. **Data Storage** – Storing raw and processed data efficiently.  
3. **Data Processing** – Cleaning, transforming, and enriching data.  
4. **Data Modeling** – Structuring data for analytics and reporting.  
5. **Data Orchestration** – Automating workflows and pipelines.  
6. **Data Delivery** – Making data accessible to end users.  
7. **Monitoring & Maintenance** – Ensuring quality, performance, and reliability.

## Key Stakeholders
- **Data Engineers:** Design and maintain data pipelines.  
- **Data Analysts:** Use processed data for insights and reports.  
- **Data Scientists:** Build models using curated data.  
- **Business Stakeholders:** Define goals and requirements.  
- **DevOps Engineers:** Manage infrastructure and automation.  

## Purpose
To provide a clear understanding of how data flows through an organization and who contributes to each phase of the lifecycle.
